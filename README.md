<h2>Morphological parser for Rutul </h2>

<h4>About Rutul</h4> 

Rutul is an endangered language spoken in Degastan(Russia) and Nothern Azerbaijan. It belongs to Lezgic group of the Northeastern Caucasian language family. It is estimated that about 50000 people speak the language. As the most sources exist on Mukhad dialect, and the Mukhad dialect has an official status and written alphabet, the Mukhad dialect was used as the main dialect for this parcer. Other dialects are marked with comments where used. 
<h4>About the Sources</h4>
This parser uses the 1978 Grammar produced by Ibragimov as the main source, as it is one of the most complete sources on Rutul. 

<h4>About this project</h4>
Currently the parcer can parse numbers and nouns, but it is a work in progress. 
More details about this parcer and the parcer for Botlikh can be found at: [in this paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1woS1dzNJDn-pb3D75tW5CIw6KdB_jMns/view?usp=sharing)

This parcer was created by Hannah Cupery as part of a larger effort at HSE to study and produce computational tools for endangered languages.
